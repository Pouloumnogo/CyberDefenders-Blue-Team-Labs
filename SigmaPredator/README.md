# SigmaPredator Windows Event Log Clearing Detection Engineering

## Project Overview

This project documents a hands-on detection engineering investigation completed through the CyberDefenders SigmaPredator lab.

The investigation focuses on identifying Windows Event Log Clearing techniques associated with attacker defense evasion and developing Sigma detection rules to identify suspicious activity.

## Scenario

As a Detection and Hunting Engineer at the fictional CyberPredator Enterprise, my objective is to research adversary techniques used to clear Windows event logs, identify relevant forensic artifacts, and develop detection rules to improve security monitoring.

## Project Objectives

- Investigate Windows Event Log Clearing techniques.
- Identify relevant Windows commands, PowerShell methods, and WMI activity.
- Analyze Windows process creation and security event logs.
- Develop Sigma detection rules.
- Validate detections using Chainsaw and historical EVTX logs.
- Document findings and recommend detection improvements.

## Tools and Technologies

- Sigma
- Chainsaw
- Visual Studio Code
- Windows Event Logs
- PowerShell
- MITRE ATT&CK

## Investigation Progress

### Phase 1: Technique Research

In progress.

### Phase 2: Sigma Rule Development and Validation

Not started.

## Evidence and Screenshots

Screenshots and detection results will be added throughout the investigation.

## Key Findings

To be completed after validating the detection rules.

## Technique Research

### Question 1 Process Creation Detection

The native Windows utility `wevtutil.exe` can be used to manage and clear event logs. Monitoring its execution helps identify suspicious log-clearing activity.
